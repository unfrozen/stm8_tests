These are some test programs that I used to verify the library functions.
(These are in stm8_libs in case you landed here from somewhere else.)
You can use them to get something working on your boards, modify them
to suit your needs, or just see how to use the library functions.

The wiki pages will give you more specific information.

UPDATES:

If you are interested in PWM, look at my "pwm_pump" project.
It is a fully working example with keypad and display.

Likewise, if you are interested in the HC-SR04 ultrasonic rangefinder
module, look at my "tank_mon" project. It uses the module to measure
the water level in a 1000 liter IBC ("tote") tank.
